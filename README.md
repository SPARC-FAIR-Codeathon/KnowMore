## About
This is the repository of Team KnowMore (Team #6) at the 2021 SPARC Codeathon. Click [here](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) to find out more about the NIH SPARC Program. Click [here](https://sparc.science/help/2021-sparc-fair-codeathon) to find out more about the SPARC Codeathon 2021. Checkout the [Team section](#team) of this page to find out more about our team members.

**No work was done on this project prior to the Codeathon**. Only the high-level idea of a knowledge discovery tool for SPARC datasets was submitted as a project suggestion for the Codeathon. The detailed outline of the project (what knowledge? what level of automation? what usecase?) were all defined jointly by the team after the kick-off of the Codeathon. The development of all the code and documentations was initiated subsequently.

## The Problem
All the datasets generated by SPARC funded projects are curated and shared according to strict guidelines that ensure these datasets are [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Specifically, the datasets are organized and annotated following the [SPARC Data Structure](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.430563v2) and then shared publicly on the SPARC Data Portal ([sparc.science](https://sparc.science/)). The SPARC program thus provides a wealth of openly available and well curated datasets that span over multiple organs, species, and datatypes. This is great! But...

While it is very easy to look at the findings of each individual dataset on the portal, there is currently **no easy way to rapidly analyze multiple SPARC datasets together**. Typically, a researcher wanting to find relations across datasets would have to do so manually, i.e., read the description of each datasets, go through their protocols, browse files that are accessible from the browser, etc. If they find that the datasets could have some interesting relations that is worth investigating further, they will then have to download each dataset (payment may be required for large datasets according to AWS pricing) before analyzing them further. This is a tedious process that needs to be urgently improved in order to enable rapid discoveries from SPARC datasets, which would 1) Enhance the speed of innovations in the neuromodulation field and 2) Elevate the impact of the SPARC program.

## Our Solution - KnowMore
To address this problem, we have developed a tool called KnowMore. KnowMore is an automated knowledge discovery tool integrated within the SPARC Portal that allows users of the portal to visualize, in just a few click, potential similarities, differences, and connections between multiple SPARC datasets of their choice. This simple process is illustrated in the figure below.

<br/>

The output of KnowMore consists of multiple interactive visualization items displayed to the user such that they can progressively gain knowledge on the potential similarities, differences, and relations across the datasets. This output is intended to provide foundational information to the user such that they can rapidly make new discoveries from SPARC datasets, generate new hypothesis, or simply decide on their next step (analyze the datasets further, remove/add datasets to their analysis, etc.). A list of the visulalization items is provided in the table below.

A sample output is presented in the figure below.

Under the hood, KnowMore uses several Machine Learning and Data Science workflows to output the above-mentioned elements, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Image clustering, and Data Correlation. Details about these are discussed in the [draft of our manuscript]() associated with this project.

## Workflow
The overall workflow of KnowMore is shown in the figure below. Our architecture consists of three main blocks that can all run independently:
1. The front end of our app is based on a fork of the sparc-app where we have integrated additional UI elements and back-end logic for KnowMore. 
2. The back-end consists of a Flask application that listen to front-end requests and launches the data processing jobs. 
3. The data processing and results generation is done through a Matlab code (for 'MAT' data files) and Python code (all other files) that are submitted to osparc.

 </p> 
<br/>

Such an architecture was motivated by our aim to make the elements KnowMore fully interoperable as well as ready to on-board the SPARC Data Portal:
* Integrating the front-end of KnowMore would only require to merge our fork of the sparc-app with the main branch sparc-app branch
* The back-end of the sparc-app, the sparc-api, is build as a Flask application so the KnowMore back-end would be readily compatible
* The data processing jobs are designed to run on osparc and would not require any type of integration

## Usecase
Our development and testing revolved around these three datasets: 
* [Quantified Morphology of the Rat Vagus Nerve](https://doi.org/10.26275/ilb9-0e2a)
* [Quantified Morphology of the Pig Vagus Nerve](https://doi.org/10.26275/maq2-eii4)
* [Quantified Morphology of the Human Vagus Nerve with Anti-Claudin-1](https://doi.org/10.26275/nluu-1ews)

They were selected due to their common theme with the aim of making some interesting and meaningful discoveries during the Codeathon. Our discoveries from these datasets are discussed in the [draft of our manuscript]() initiated during the Codeathon. Our results can be reproduced by selecting these dataset when using KnowMore (see next section). We would like to emphasize that our tool is not specifically designed around these datasets and is intended to work with any user selected datasets. 

## Using KnowMore
You can use KnowMore directly on our fork of the SPARC Data Portal: (add link)

Follow the steps described below:
1. Find datasets of interest and click on the "Add to automated discovery" button, visible in the header of the datasets, to add each of them in the KnowMore analysis 
2. Go to the KnowMore tab, and check that all your selected datasets are listed
3. Click on "Discover" to initiate the automated discovery process
4. Wait until the results are displayed

## Using the Source Code

### Prerequisites 
We recommend using Anaconda to create and manage your development environments for KnowMore. All the subsequent instructions are provided assuming you are using [Anaconda (Python 3 version)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

### Running the app
To use the source code, clone or download the repository first.
```
git clone https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/KnowMore.git --recurse
```

Run our back-end flask-server following the documentation [available here](https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/KnowMore/blob/main/README.flask.md).

Run our fork the sparc-app by following the documentation [available here](https://github.com/RyanQuey/sparc-app/tree/84ab5df2203ef0a551051cf0ac037762dbc4e7dc).

Our back-end data processing programs consists of a Matlab code for handling 'MAT' files (when found in a dataset) and a Python code (for processing all other datatypes). They run on osparc and, as such do not require, any local setup. The documentation for using/editing them is, however, [available here](https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/KnowMore/blob/main/README.flask.md) if needed.

## Progress during the Codeathon and future work
Details about our progress during thus Hackathon and future items we intended to complete afterwards are provided [here](). Some of these items are also discussed in the [draft of our manuscript]() associated with this project.
